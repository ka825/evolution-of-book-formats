	<p class="intro1">The idea of books started with the use of clay tablets dating back to 5,000 BC show writing did not appear in Mesopotamia first. The first attempt of writing words on movable objects is found to be made by Sumerians, an ancient group of people of Mesopotamia who lived there around 3500-3000 B.C. The use of clay tablets to write text was around for 2000 years. Then, the papyrus Scrolls were made from the stem of the Papyrus plant by ancient Egyptians. </p> 

<p class="intro1">Codex brought written manuscripts closer to modern books. It was difficult to open and read longer scrolls and they were also easily, breakable. In a codex, pages were bound together, one after another. The main advantage of codex over scrolls was that it could be at once opened to any point and was easy to handle. It also made it possible to write on both sides of a page. The pages were generally made of folded leaves or parchments bound together on one side. </p> 
  
<p class="intro1">Paper is believed to be have been invented in China in 105 A.D. The credit of the invention of paper goes to the Chinese imperial court of Eastern Han, Cai Lun.  Soon paper started being used in China and also spread all across the world. Block printing is also believed to have originated in China. This technique was more like today’s stamp, just that the whole book was used as a stamp.   </p>

			<p class="intro2">Bi Sheng of China invented movable type around 990-1051 A.D. He started the system of carving a single letter on a small piece of clay or wood. Instead of carving the whole book on a single block. This method proved to be more efficient as blocks could be rearranged and reused again and again. In Korea, the first metal movable type was created around 1230 A.D. Jikji is considered as the first movable metal print book which came to existence in 1377 A.D. </p>
  
<p class="intro2">Johannes Gutenberg brought a revolution to the world of printing, and writing.  He developed a metal movable type system of casting letters with screw press and hand mold. Gutenberg’s machine was semi mechanic, but it was very efficient. It is considered one of the most important inventions of all time. The Gutenberg Bible was the first complete book printed in Gutenberg’s movable printing press in 1455. </p>

 <p class="intro2">Gutenberg’s invention led to a revolution in printing activities all over Europe. By the late 15th century, more than 20 million books were published in more than 200 countries in Europe.  Eventually, in the 1490s, the printing revolution crossed Europe and reached other continents as well. In the 21st century, with the invention of the computer, microprocessor, and the internet, books have seen a major digital transformation. </p>

			<h3 class="physicalsub">Paperback</h3>
			 <p class="paperback">The introduction of a new format in the 1930s, the paperback, was considered revolutionary. The so-called paperback revolution began during the Great Depression, when paperbacks were marketed as inexpensive alternatives to hardcover editions. Penguin Books, Ltd., the first majorly successful paperback publishing company, kept prices low by ordering large print runs and selling books in nontraditional retailers, such as Woolworth’s drugstores. Penguin also broke the traditional paperback mold by avoiding pulp fiction entertainment novels and instead printing books that were both cheap and intellectually stimulating.</p>

			<p class="paperback">Paperback originals were another step in helping to remove the stigma from the paperback book. Today’s books published in paperback are traditionally divided into two broad categories: mass-market paperbacks and trade paperbacks. Mass-market paperbacks are small, inexpensive editions that are sometimes issued after a hardcover edition, although many genre novels are printed only in mass-market paperback editions. Trade paperbacks are larger and generally of better quality.</p></div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="columns_2">
			<h3 class="physicalsub">Hardcover</h3>
			<p class="hardcover">While the first codices enclosed bound papers between wooden covers, contemporary hardcover book covers are usually made of cardboard sheathed in cloth, paper, or leather. The printed pages of the book are either sewn or glued to the cover. Until the early 1800s, most books were sold unbound. A buyer would purchase a sheath of printed papers that would be bound either by the bookseller or by a commissioned bindery. British publisher William Pickering is considered the first publisher to issue books in uniform cloth bindings in 1820. About a decade later, dust jackets, the detachable outer covers that sheathe most hardback books today, arrived on the scene.</p>

			<p class="hardcover">The durability of hardcover books makes them attractive to both authors and book purchasers. However, the competitive economics of today’s publishing industry means that some books are never issued in hardcover. Because hardcover books are more expensive to produce and almost always cost more than their paperback equivalents, publishers tend to reserve the format for books that they expect will sell well. </p></div>

			<h2 class="digitaltitle">Digital Formats</h2>
			<h3 class="ebooktitle">E-Books</h3>
			<p class="ebooks">E-books, also known as electronic or digital books, are the digital media equivalent of printed books. That is, they are books read on the screen of an electronic device, whether a cell phone, personal computer, or dedicated e-book reader. E-books differ from their print equivalents in many significant ways. For one, there’s no physical production cost, which means that e-books are generally less expensive than traditional books. There’s also no cost to store or transport e-books. </p>
				
			<p class="ebooks">E-books also appeal to readers who want instant gratification. Instead of having to travel to a brick-and-mortar bookstore or wait for a delivery, a reader can download an e-book in a matter of minutes. Early e-books were mostly technical manuals or digitized versions of works in the public domain. As the Internet took off and as electronic devices became increasingly mobile, book publishers began to issue digital editions of their works. In the first decade of the 21st century, various companies began issuing software and hardware platforms for electronic books.</p>

			<h3 class="audiobooktitle">Audiobooks</h3>
			<p class="audiobooks">Audiobooks can be dated back to the 1930s. They were often used as an educational medium, found in schools and libraries. Before audiobooks were available digitally, talking books, as they were often referred to, were sold in physical form on analog cassette tapes and vinyl records. However, with the invention of the internet, a vast selection of audiobooks were available from many different sources. Audiobooks are voice recordings of the text of a book that you listen to rather than read. They can be an exact word-for-word versions of books or abridged versions. You can listen to audiobooks on any smartphone, tablet, computer, or in-car entertainment system. They can also be purchased from online bookstores or downloaded free from public domain sites. </p>
